- Hi, I’m @thelazyant164
- I’m a ComSci/Game student at Swinburne Uni, majoring in SoftDev - although I consider GameDev to be my ride-or-die.
- I have a keen interest in interactive narrative design, rapid prototyping and system architecture, though I am naturally curious and would love to expand my horizons.
- I’m open to collaborate on any software/tool/app/game projects.
- Reach me via my [personal](mailto:lythienan164@gmail.com) or [school](mailto:103499753@student.swin.edu.au) email.
